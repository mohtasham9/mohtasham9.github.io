In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, building high-performance and scalable APIs is essential for modern applications. Thankfully, with the advent of powerful Python frameworks like FastAPI and tools like Mangum and Uvicorn, developers now have the means to unlock unparalleled speed, efficiency, and scalability in their web applications.

In this tutorial, we’ll walk through the process of deploying a FastAPI (a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+) application on AWS Lambda, a serverless computing service, and expose it to the world using AWS API Gateway. We’ll also utilize tools like uvicorn for local testing and Magnum for containerization.
